        <p class="info-text">My name is Deidara Champ and this is my first project. The project is called
            “TeacherStudents” and is made with PHP and as a database, MySQL. </p>

        <p class="info-text">This is a web application where a teacher grades his student while the student is
            assigned to courses. It only has two roles and is a very short app. Here is a video
            of how it works:</p>
